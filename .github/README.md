# imagesk
A scripts folder that registers custom syntaxes for image processing in Skript.

Requires *latest* [skript-mirror](https://github.com/btk5h/skript-mirror) and [Skript](https://github.com/bensku/Skript) v2.2+.

Please always use the latest version of skript-mirror and imagesk. If you see any error, try to update them. If that doesn't solve the error then contact with me.

## Installing
1. Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/Blueyescat/imagesk/releases)
1. Download the `imagesk.zip` file
1. Unzip/open the zip, copy the `imagesk` **folder** inside and paste it into your `Skript/scripts/` folder

When updating imagesk, just get the new folder and **replace** with your old folder.

To reload/enable/disable imagesk, use **`/sk reload imagesk/`** since it is a folder.
